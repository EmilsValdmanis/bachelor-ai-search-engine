# Bachelor AI Search Engine

This is an AI-powered search engine built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed as part of a Bachelor's thesis project. The goal of this project is to explore and implement generative AI techniques to enhance information retrieval and test if the UX is better or worse in AI search engines compared to traditional ones.
