# Bachelor AI Search Engine

This is an AI-powered search engine built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed as part of a Bachelor's thesis project. The goal of this project is to explore and implement generative AI techniques to enhance information retrieval and test if the UX is better or worse in AI search engines compared to traditional ones.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application in action.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Package Scripts

The project includes the following scripts for development and production:

- `dev`: Runs the development server with Turbopack for faster builds.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
- `build`: Creates an optimized production build.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
- `start`: Starts the production server.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
- `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
- `format`: Formats the codebase using Prettier.
    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```
